## Algorithm Design and Techniques

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

- **Proof by induction**
    - It allows to prove a statement about an arbitrary number n by:
        - 1st proving it's true when n is 1 and then 
        - assuming it's true for n = k and showing it's true for n = k + 1
    - [For more details](http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sormani/teaching/induction.html)
- **Proofs  by contradiction**
    - It allow to prove a proposition is valid (true) by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction
    - [For more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction)
- **T(n)** is the number of lines of code executed by an algorithm

<summary>Approaches</summary>

- **Tournament** approach:
    - To find the kth largest number in an array, compare each paire of 2 elements together
    - compare(elem 0, elem 1), compare(elem 2, elem 3)...
    - O(n + log(n) âˆ’ 2)
- **Euclidean** Algorithm
