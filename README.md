## Algorithm Design and Techniques

<details>
<summary>Proofs</summary>

- **Proof by induction**
    - It allows to prove a statement about an arbitrary number n by:
        - 1st proving it's true when n is 1 and then 
        - assuming it's true for n = k and showing it's true for n = k + 1
    - [For more details](http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sormani/teaching/induction.html)
- **Proofs  by contradiction**
    - It allow to prove a proposition is valid (true) by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction
